The mathematical model of the quadrotor is derived using the Euler-Newton formalism with extended assumptions on disturbing aerodynamical forces (not necessary uniformly bounded). The proposed control demonstrates an enhanced robustness against such disturbances. The comparison between the classical controller and the proposed one is demonstrated analytically, through Lyapunov theory, and in simulations to validate the proposed sliding mode control algorithm.},

abstract = {The motion of a UAV is greatly influenced by its interaction with different kinds of surfaces in proximity. In this paper, we address the aerodynamic challenge termed as ‘The ground effect' faced by a UAV, by mathematical modelling of its dynamic response. An AR Drone 2.0 has been used to collect the variations of parameters such as roll and pitch at different heights above a smooth surface. The data thus obtained has been analyzed on MATLAB R2013a and mathematical models have been created to correct them for a more stable take-off, landing and near ground flights. The controller in a UAV constantly adjusts to stabilize the UAV. Results show that model obtained can be used to counter the ground effect in UAVs. The model obtained would also decrease stress on the controller and it will consume less power as it would not have to expend extra power in attempting to stabilize the UAV.},

The quadrotor robot is based on Parrot ARDrone quadrotor with Wi-Fi adapters and added GPS module. This research focuses only on the self-deployment movement algorithm of the quadrotors which is based on Takahashi's distributed self-deployment algorithm.

@techreport{AMVargas2017,
abstract = {Drones are being used in an increasing number of civilian applications. The quadcopter is a type of drone which has undergone extensive research making it an excellent testbed for novel control techniques. Several intended uses of quadcopters require operation in confined environments, in which objects are in close proximity to the vehicle. In these conditions, the flight is affected by aerodynamic interactions (force and torque). Intuitively, these in-teractions can be viewed as air flow rebounding on the surroundings back to the vehicle. The development of efficient computational approaches for describing such interactions re-mains open to improvement as existing accurate models require a considerable amount of computational load and cannot be used in the real-time control loop of the quadrotor. This research hypothesizes that with a simplified mathematical model, which can be deployed in real-time and approximates the behavior of the aerodynamic interactions, the flight control of the quadrotor is improved. In seeking to confirm this hypothesis, the aim is to develop an efficient model of aerodynamic interactions which can be retrieved from simulated and experimental data. Three major areas of knowledge shall be explored to solve the problem: control theory, artificial intelligence, and fluid mechanics. As a preliminary progress, numer-ical optimization techniques for nonlinear quadrotor control are proposed.},

The theory has been extended to include the effect of a variation in blade loading coefficient and shows that, within the range that this parameter takes on present single-rotor helicopters, the effect is small. The effect of fitting flat surfaces beneath the rotor is also considered and it is shown that the ratio of the thrust in the ground cushion to the thrust clear of the ground, at constant power, is greater for the winged helicopter, but that for the salne rotor operating at constant power, the clean helicopter will have the higher net thrust for speeds less than the stalling speeds of the attached surfaces.},

abstract = {Ground effect on rotary aircraft has been studied for many decades. Although a large body of research results is now available for conventional helicopters, this topic is just beginning to receive attention in the unmanned aerial vehicle community, particularly for small size UAVs. The objective of this paper is to assess the applicability of a widely-used ground effect model, developed in the middle of last century, for predicting the ground effect on a small rotary UAV. The particular vehicle employed in this work, the Draganflyer X8, is actuated by 8 propellers arranged in 4 coaxial pairs in a quadrotor configuration and is currently employed for the development of autonomous landing capabilities for UAVs. The aforementioned ground effect model gives an explicit relationship between the thrust produced by a single propeller while operating in-ground-effect and the thrust out-of-ground effect, as a function of the normalized propeller height above ground. A series of experiments was conducted with the propellers of the vehicle on a test stand, and with the X8 vehicle in flight, from which we obtained the in-ground and out-of-ground thrusts. Juxtaposition of our results against the theoretical model points to a stronger ground effect on the X8 vehicle than predicted by theory. Discussion of the assumptions underlying the theory and the experimental procedures and their implications on the results obtained is also included in the paper.},

abstract = {The automatic landing of a quadrotor is often associated with model uncertainties, measurement noises, and ground effect phenomenon. To mitigate these challenges, the accurate estimation of states especially the height above the ground, and its rate of change is vital. Moreover, the error of ground effect model can also be estimated and compensated during landing. In this paper, the recently developed continuous ant colony filter is implemented for integrated estimation of states and parameters. The estimated states are used in height control loop. To investigate the closed loop performance of the filter, two control strategies, a classical proportional-integral-derivative controller and a sliding mode controller are utilized and their performance are compared in the presence of ground effect compensation and without it. Also, the error of ground effect model is estimated and compensated in landing algorithm. Finally, a landing procedure is proposed including a ground effect estimation phase before the touchdown. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm effectively improves the landing performance when the ground effect is properly compensated. Moreover, small estimation errors, obtained from the simulations, prove the good performance of the new filter in states and parameters estimation. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The wake characteristics of a rotorcraft are affected by the proximity of a rotor to the ground surface, especially during hover. Ground effect is encountered when the rotor disk is within a distance of a few rotor radii above the ground surface and results in an increase in thrust for a given power relative to that same power condition with the rotor out of ground effect. Although this phenomenon has been highly documented and observed since the beginning of the helicopter age, there is still a relatively little amount of flowfield data existing to help understand its features. Joint Army and NASA testing was conducted at NASA Langley Research Center using a powered rotorcraft model in hover at various rotor heights and thrust conditions in order to contribute to the complete outwash data set. The measured data included outwash velocities and directions, rotor loads, fuselage loads, and ground pressures. The researchers observed a linear relationship between rotor height and percent download on the fuselage, peak mean outwash velocities occurring at radial stations between 1.7 and 1.8 r/R regardless of rotor height, and the measurement azimuthal dependence of the outwash profile for a model incorporating a fuselage. Comparisons to phase-locked PIV data showed similar contours but a more contracted wake boundary for the PIV data. This paper describes the test setup and presents some of the averaged results.},
